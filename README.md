- 👋 Hi, I’m @1116574 - Paweł
- 🏙️ I am from Warsaw, Poland
- 👀 I program with public open data, back-end stuff, mainly
- 🪐 I like to check out weird/new protocoles, like [gemini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(protocol))
- ...and learn about old but still useful standards, like ID3 or Atom/RSS
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Unicode, encodings, and trying to get more into Docker and Rust
